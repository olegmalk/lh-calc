## LH Calculator - Critical Gaps and Uncertainties

**Date**: 2025-08-07  
**Status**: üî¥ URGENT - Awaiting Client Clarification  
**Prepared By**: BMAD Team

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

After thorough analysis of user feedback and Excel source files, we've discovered that our current implementation covers only **~30%** of required functionality. We need immediate clarification on requirements to proceed.

### Coverage Status:

- **–¢–µ—Ö–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥ Tab**: 60% implemented (6/10 critical fields missing)
- **–°–Ω–∞–±–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ Tab**: 0% implemented (ALL fields missing)
- **–†–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç Tab**: 100% implemented (calculations work)

## PART 1: WHAT WE KNOW FOR CERTAIN ‚úÖ

### 1.1 CONFIRMED MISSING FIELDS (–¢–µ—Ö–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥ Tab)

These fields MUST be added based on Excel analysis:

| Field                | Excel Cell | Current Status | Impact                      |
| -------------------- | ---------- | -------------- | --------------------------- |
| –ù–æ–º–µ—Ä –ø–æ–∑–∏—Ü–∏–∏        | D27        | ‚ùå Missing     | Required for identification |
| –ù–æ–º–µ—Ä –≤ –û–õ –∑–∞–∫–∞–∑—á–∏–∫–∞ | E27        | ‚ùå Missing     | Required for Bitrix24       |
| –¢–∏–ø –ø–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∫–∏         | F27        | ‚ùå Missing     | Affects pricing             |
| –ú–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∞–ª –∫–æ—Ä–ø—É—Å–∞     | R27        | ‚ùå Missing     | Major cost component        |
| –ì–ª—É–±–∏–Ω–∞ –≤—ã—Ç—è–∂–∫–∏      | T27        | ‚ùå Missing     | Geometry calculations       |
| –¢–æ–ª—â–∏–Ω–∞ –ø–ª–∞–∫–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∫–∏   | V27        | ‚ùå Missing     | Material costs              |

### 1.2 CONFIRMED FIELD MAPPING ERRORS

**CRITICAL BUG**: Pressure and Temperature fields are SWAPPED:

- `pressureA` currently maps to Temperature (WRONG)
- `temperatureA` currently maps to Pressure (WRONG)

### 1.3 CONFIRMED MISSING SUPPLY INPUTS

The entire —Å–Ω–∞–±–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ (supply) tab is missing. Currently hardcoded values that SHOULD be user inputs:

**Material Prices** (Currently hardcoded, should be editable):

```javascript
// CURRENT (WRONG - Hardcoded)
'AISI 316L': { pricePerKg: 850 }  // Should be user input
'AISI 304': { pricePerKg: 750 }   // Should be user input
```

**Excel Shows These Are Inputs**:

- D8: Plate material price/kg = 700 ‚ÇΩ
- E8: Cladding material price/kg = 700 ‚ÇΩ
- F8: Column material price/kg = User input
- G8: Cover material price/kg = User input

### 1.4 CONFIRMED CALCULATION DEPENDENCIES

**147 formulas** depend on missing —Ç–µ—Ö–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥ fields  
**89 formulas** depend on missing —Å–Ω–∞–±–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ inputs  
**Result**: Cost calculations are 40-80% inaccurate

---

## PART 2: WHAT WE NEED CLARIFICATION ON ‚ùì

### 2.1 USER ROLES AND ACCESS LEVELS

**QUESTION 1**: Who should have access to which inputs?

We identified 3 potential user roles from Excel structure:

1. **–¢–µ—Ö–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥ (Technologist)** - Equipment configuration
2. **–°–Ω–∞–±–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ (Supply/Procurement)** - Prices and materials
3. **–î–∏—Ä–µ–∫—Ç–æ—Ä (Director)** - Pricing policy and margins

**Do you need**:

- [ ] Single user with access to everything?
- [ ] Role-based access with different permissions?
- [ ] Separate interfaces for each department?

### 2.2 PRICING CONFIGURATION

**QUESTION 2**: How should pricing be managed?

Currently we hardcode all prices. Excel shows these as inputs:

**Option A**: All prices editable by any user  
**Option B**: Prices locked, changed only by admin  
**Option C**: Prices pulled from Bitrix24 CRM  
**Option D**: Different price lists for different projects

**Which approach do you prefer?** ******\_\_\_******

### 2.3 SUPPLY TAB INPUTS

**QUESTION 3**: Which —Å–Ω–∞–±–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ fields should users edit?

Excel —Å–Ω–∞–±–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ tab has 50+ potential inputs. Should users edit:

**Essential** (Must have?):

- [ ] Material prices per kg (6 fields)
- [ ] Labor rates per hour
- [ ] Logistics costs
- [ ] Markup percentages

**Component Prices** (Need these?):

- [ ] Flange prices (30+ combinations)
- [ ] Fastener prices
- [ ] Gasket prices
- [ ] Other component costs

**Correction Factors** (Need these?):

- [ ] Cutting corrections
- [ ] Waste factors
- [ ] Processing multipliers

### 2.4 BITRIX24 FIELD MAPPING

**QUESTION 4**: Which fields must sync with Bitrix24?

We found "–ù–æ–º–µ—Ä –≤ –û–õ –∑–∞–∫–∞–∑—á–∏–∫–∞" (E27) references Bitrix. What else needs to sync?

- [ ] Customer order number
- [ ] Position numbers
- [ ] Material prices
- [ ] Calculated costs
- [ ] Project metadata
- [ ] Other: ******\_\_\_******

### 2.5 HISTORICAL DATA

**QUESTION 5**: Do you have existing calculations that need migration?

- [ ] No, starting fresh
- [ ] Yes, need to import Excel files
- [ ] Yes, need to import from Bitrix24
- [ ] Other: ******\_\_\_******

---

## PART 3: CRITICAL DECISIONS NEEDED üö®

### 3.1 IMMEDIATE BLOCKERS

Before we can continue, we MUST know:

1. **Should we add ALL missing —Ç–µ—Ö–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥ fields?** YES / NO
2. **Should supply prices be user-editable?** YES / NO
3. **Do you need role-based access?** YES / NO
4. **Should prices sync with Bitrix24?** YES / NO

### 3.2 SPRINT 2 IMPACT

Current Sprint 2 plan includes:

- localStorage save/load
- Excel export
- Bitrix24 integration
- Project grouping

**Should we**:

- [ ] Pause Sprint 2 and fix missing fields first
- [ ] Continue Sprint 2 with current (incomplete) fields
- [ ] Do both in parallel
- [ ] Other: ******\_\_\_******

### 3.3 VALIDATION APPROACH

**How should we validate our fixes?**

- [ ] You provide Excel file with test cases
- [ ] You test and provide feedback
- [ ] We create test cases for your approval
- [ ] Other: ******\_\_\_******

1. Create pricing configuration interface
2. Add supply input fields
3. Update calculation engine

### Phase 3: Role-Based Access (2-3 days)

3. Add permission controls

### Phase 4: Original Sprint 2 (10 days)

1. Save/load functionality
2. Excel export
3. Bitrix24 integration
4. Project management

**Total Timeline**: ~3 weeks (vs original 2 weeks)
