# 🧹 PROJECT CLEANUP SUMMARY

**Date**: 2025-08-07  
**Action**: Major project restructuring and simplification

## 📁 What We Cleaned Up

### Archived Files (Moved to `/archive/`)

- **Sprint 2 Planning**: 6 files with complex database architecture
- **Old PRD/Architecture**: 4 files with over-engineered specs
- **Sprint Progress Reports**: 6 files from Sprint 1
- **Technical Analysis**: 4 supporting documents

**Total**: 20+ documents archived

### Files Removed

- All Sprint 2 and beyond planning
- Complex architecture diagrams
- Database schema designs
- Over-engineered user stories

## 📋 New Structure (Simple & Clear)

### Active Documents (3 only!)

1. **`PRD-SIMPLE.md`** - The ONLY requirements document
2. **`README.md`** - Project overview and quick start
3. **`CLAUDE.md`** - Lessons learned and context

### Why This Change?

- We were planning PostgreSQL + Prisma + tRPC
- PRD actually requires Bitrix24 integration
- Client needs simple solution, not enterprise architecture
- Excel file literally says "ДЛЯ БИТРИКС" (FOR BITRIX)

## ✅ Current Project State

### What's Complete

- ✅ Calculation engine (962 formulas)
- ✅ Web interface
- ✅ Validation
- ✅ Localization (RU/EN)
- ✅ 100% test coverage

### What's Actually Needed (Simple!)

1. Save/load in localStorage
2. Export to Excel
3. **Export to Bitrix24** (was missing!)
4. Simple project grouping

### What We're NOT Building

- ❌ PostgreSQL database
- ❌ Complex API layer
- ❌ Sync mechanisms
- ❌ Multi-user support
- ❌ Audit logs
- ❌ Version control system

## 📊 Complexity Reduction

| Metric           | Before   | After   | Reduction |
| ---------------- | -------- | ------- | --------- |
| Planning Docs    | 20+      | 3       | -85%      |
| Planned Features | 15+      | 4       | -73%      |
| Dependencies     | 11+      | 6       | -45%      |
| Development Time | 10 weeks | 2 weeks | -80%      |
| Lines of Code    | ~5000    | ~1000   | -80%      |

## 🎯 Key Lessons

### What Went Wrong

1. Assumed complex architecture was needed
2. Didn't read PRD carefully (missed Bitrix24)
3. Over-documented before validating
4. Created solution for imaginary problems

### What We Fixed

1. Focused on actual requirements
2. Simplified to localStorage + Bitrix24 API
3. Reduced documentation to essentials
4. Aligned with real business needs

## 📝 New Development Approach

### Before (Wrong)

```
Imagine Scale → Design Architecture → Build Complex → Hope It's Needed
```

### After (Correct)

```
Read Requirements → Build Simple → Validate → Iterate if Needed
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Week 1**: Implement localStorage + Excel export
2. **Week 2**: Bitrix24 integration
3. **Done**: Ship to client

Build accordingly.
