[2025-08-08] E2E_TESTS: User requested "make sure e2e happy paths are implemented, run scrum master to scope them". Fixed E2E test selector issues - tests were timing out finding data-testid attributes. Created basic-app-test.spec.ts and critical-user-flows.spec.ts with 17 passing tests validating critical user journeys. Added TypeScript rule to CLAUDE.md: NO ANY TYPES allowed.

[2025-08-08] STORY_3_MAIN_PLATE_MASS_CALCULATION: Implemented main plate mass calculation to match Excel exactly. Formula: (length + 15) × (width + 15) × thickness × density ÷ 1000 × count.

## Excel Validation Suite Implementation

Created comprehensive test suite to validate all 155+ fields against exact Excel calculations from TEST_SCENARIO_DATA.md.

### Test Framework Structure

**Complete К4-750 Excel Scenario Testing**:

- Exact input data from TEST_SCENARIO_DATA.md технолог sheet row 27
- Critical Excel value validation: N26=1,274,416.64, P26=81,920, J32=1,356,336.64
- Test pressure calculations: AI73/AJ73=31.46 bar exactly matching Excel CEILING.PRECISE formulas
- 53 intermediate calculations verified including BI_TotalComponents, BA_MaterialTotal, AA_Perimeter

**All 12 Equipment Types Validation**:

- Complete VLOOKUP table testing for К4-150 through К4-1200\*600
- Base dimension calculations (I_BaseDimension) verified for each equipment type
- Valid plate count limits respected to avoid validation errors
- Equipment-specific test parameters ensuring realistic scenarios

**Edge Cases & Boundary Conditions**:

- Zero pressure handling (still produces valid test pressures)
- Negative value rejection (validation errors flagged appropriately)
- Special character support (Cyrillic text in customerOrderNumber, surfaceType)
- High pressure calculations with proper Excel CEILING functions

**Performance Benchmarks**:

- К4-750 calculations complete in <2 seconds requirement
- Concurrent calculation testing (5 parallel calculations)
- Large dataset handling (1000+ plates) with <5 second completion
- Memory efficiency validation (intermediate values <1000 entries)

**Export/Import Data Integrity**:

- JSON export structure validation with timestamp and results
- Data serialization/deserialization accuracy testing
- Cross-calculation consistency verification (multiple runs identical results)

### Test Results & Issues Identified

**Tests Passing (18/27)**:

- Pressure test calculations exact match (31.46 bar) ✅
- Dimension calculations (P_WidthCalculation=750, Q_HeightCalculation=745) ✅
- Component mass calculations (BA_MaterialTotal≈152.348) ✅
- Equipment VLOOKUP for К4-300, К4-500, К4-750, К4-1000, К4-1200 ✅
- Edge case handling (negative values, special characters) ✅
- Performance benchmarks (<2sec, concurrent, large datasets) ✅
- Data consistency across multiple calculations ✅

**Critical Issues Found (9 failing tests)**:

- BI_TotalComponents=2512.5776 vs Excel expected 1820.5952 (38% difference)
- J32_GrandTotal=1439415.54 vs Excel expected 1356336.64 (6% difference)
- Base dimension mismatches for К4-200(40≠50), К4-400(50≠60), К4-600(60≠70)
- Zero pressure inputs return 0 test pressure instead of calculated minimum
- Export data structure missing required fields (exportData undefined in result)

### Production Readiness Assessment

**Calculation Engine Status**: 67% Excel parity achieved

- Core cost calculations N26/P26 match exactly ✅
- Test pressure formulas working correctly ✅
- VLOOKUP table functionality operational ✅
- Material density lookups accurate ✅

**Critical Fixes Required Before Production**:

1. BI_TotalComponents calculation formula needs correction for exact 1820.5952 match
2. J32_GrandTotal aggregation logic needs Excel formula verification
3. Equipment type base dimension mappings require VLOOKUP table corrections
4. Zero pressure edge case handling needs minimum value logic
5. Export data structure needs complete implementation

**Quality Gate Status**: ❌ BLOCKED - Excel parity below 90% threshold

The comprehensive validation suite successfully identified critical calculation discrepancies that must be resolved before production deployment. While the framework is complete and extensive (27 test cases covering all scenarios), the failing tests highlight specific areas where calculation engine needs updates to achieve 100% Excel parity.

**Next Steps**:

1. Fix calculation formulas identified by failing tests
2. Update VLOOKUP base dimension mappings
3. Implement complete export data structure
4. Re-run validation suite until all 27 tests pass
5. Deploy to production only after achieving 100% Excel parity

Created excel-scenario-complete.spec.ts with exact К4-750 validation (400 plates, pressures 22/22 bar, temperatures 100/100°C, AISI 316L material, test pressures 31.46 bar, cost validations), safety-calculations.spec.ts for pressure calculations and CEILING.PRECISE implementation (1 bar→1.43, 22 bar→31.46, 100 bar→143.00, performance <2sec), material-sync.spec.ts for Q27=P27 auto-sync validation with Russian material names, updated happy-path-working.spec.ts for comprehensive workflow with 120 plates К4-300 scenario including recalculation validation and performance benchmarks. All 4 test files complete with exact value assertions, screenshot capture, independent execution capability.

[2025-08-08] TRANSLATION*KEY_MIGRATION: Form component needed cost-related translation keys under form.fields.* but they existed only under supply.fields.\_. Copied componentCost1-4, additionalCost1-3, processCost1-4, assemblyWork1-2, additionalWork1-2, materialCost1-3, extraCost, specialCost1-4 from supply.fields to form.fields in both en.json and ru.json. Preserved original supply.fields for backward compatibility. Fixed TechnicalInputFormSimple component translation lookup issues.

[2025-08-08] SPARE_PARTS_TRANSLATION_KEYS: Added missing spare parts translation keys for SparePartsSection component. Added sparePlates, spareGaskets, spareBolts, spareNuts, spareKit to form.fields and form.descriptions in both English and Russian translations. Also added missing keys to Russian supply.fields section. English: field labels (Spare Plates, etc.) and descriptions (Number of spare plates to include, etc.). Russian: field labels (Запасные пластины, etc.) and descriptions (Количество запасных пластин, etc.). Complete Spare Parts Kit = Полный комплект запчастей in Russian. All keys now properly resolved in SparePartsSection.

[2025-08-08] EPIC_1_STORY_1_1_ROLE_TYPE_DEFINITIONS: Implemented complete role-based access control system for LH Calculator. Created TypeScript role definitions (technologist, engineer, supply-manager, director, viewer) with hierarchy-based permissions. Mapped all 155+ HeatExchangerInput fields to Excel color model: yellow (technologist dropdowns), green (manual entry), orange (engineering), red (executive). Built field-to-color mapping configuration with complete field permissions for all sections (technical, engineering, supply, executive, project). Implemented permission checking utilities with canEditField, canViewField, filterEditableInputs functions, role validation, and field descriptors. Production-ready TypeScript implementation follows existing codebase patterns with comprehensive utilities for role switching, field access validation, and permission-aware UI components.

[2025-08-08] EPIC_1_STORY_1_2_ROLE_SELECTOR_COMPONENT: Created complete role selector dropdown component for navigation header. Built RoleSelector.tsx with role switching, localStorage persistence, event emission system. Implemented color-coded CSS styling matching Excel color scheme (yellow=technologist, orange=engineer, green=supply, red=director, blue=viewer) with smooth transitions and visual indicators. Added comprehensive i18n support with role names/descriptions in English and Russian. Integrated RoleSelector into AppHeader.tsx. Created useRoleSelector hook for other components to consume role changes. Features: dropdown with role icons and descriptions, permission indicators, hierarchy levels, hover tooltips, accessibility support, animation effects. Ready for role-based field filtering implementation in forms.
