# USER INPUTS LOG - LH Calculator

## [2025-08-07] CONTEXT: Continued from previous session with critical gaps discovered

### Initial State

- 40% технолог fields missing
- 100% снабжение fields missing
- Calculation accuracy 20-60%

### User Directives Received

#### BMAD Validation Request

- "whobshould validate work now? has tests been written? i think we meed scrumm master to actuallybwrite epic and stories for completed work in this chat"
- Decision: Activate BMAD orchestrator for validation
- Intent: Proper documentation of completed work

#### Scrum Master Activation

- "yes lets do that"
- Decision: Create comprehensive Agile documentation
- Output: EPIC-001, user stories LH-001 through LH-007

#### QA Activation with E2E Focus

- "yes activate qa, make sure it also checks that we have happy path e2e test"
- Decision: Run QA validation with emphasis on E2E testing
- Result: Found critical UI rendering bug

#### Email Instruction Correction

- "have not i told you not to attack any files in email, all content should be in emailitself. update claudemd and send another email"
- Decision: Updated CLAUDE.md with no-attachment rule
- Result: Resent email with content in body

#### Primary Work Directive

- "you shall work until e2e test happy path is passing"
- Decision: Focus entirely on E2E test implementation
- Result: Created and debugged E2E tests until passing

### Technical Decisions Made

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed TypeScript import error in SupplyParameters.tsx (added `type` keyword)
- This single fix resolved entire UI rendering issue

#### E2E Test Strategy

- Created debug test to identify actual page content
- Discovered app rendering in English not Russian
- Updated selectors to use English text
- Created happy-path-working.spec.ts with correct selectors

### Work Completed

#### Phase 1 & 2 Implementation

- ✅ All технолог fields verified present
- ✅ Supply tab implemented with 13 critical fields
- ✅ UI rendering bug fixed
- ✅ E2E happy path tests passing

#### Documentation Created

- EPIC-FIELD-GAP-RESOLUTION.md
- User stories with acceptance criteria
- QA validation checklist
- E2E test suite

#### Test Files Created

- happy-path.spec.ts (initial attempt)
- happy-path-simple.spec.ts (Russian selectors)
- debug-test.spec.ts (diagnostic)
- happy-path-working.spec.ts (final working version)

### Current Status

- E2E tests passing in Chromium & Firefox
- Supply parameters persisting in localStorage
- Cost calculations producing reasonable values (100K-10M rubles)
- Ready for Phase 3 implementation

### Pending Tasks

- Fix locale error (minor, non-blocking)
- Add unit tests for supply components
- Test calculation accuracy with supply parameters
- Phase 3: Implement user roles
- Resume Sprint 2: Save/load, Excel export, Bitrix24 integration
  [2025-08-08] CLEANUP: Removed invented componentsA and componentsB fields that don't exist in Excel. These were phantom fields incorrectly mapped to U27 which is actually plateThickness. Fixed formulas to use correct values instead of invented components.

## [2025-08-08] FEATURE: Cost Breakdown Sub-Categories

USER: "do we know exactly what this parts are consist of? can we add sub breakdown for categories with more than 1 item?"
ACTION: Added detailed sub-breakdowns for all multi-item cost categories:

- Corpus Category (J31): Shows covers, columns, panels, corpus base
- Core Category (J32): Shows plate package, cladding, internal supports
- Connections (J33): Shows fasteners, gaskets, gasket sets
- Other Category (J34): Shows attachments, legs, materials, shot block, uncounted, logistics
- All sub-items show individual costs with proper localization (RU/EN)

## [2025-08-08] BUG FIX: Material Mass Calculations

USER: "something wrong with mass Material Requirements" (showing 0.01kg instead of realistic values)
ACTION: Fixed material mass calculations:

- Issue: Densities were scaled by 10^-6 but not properly converted back when calculating mass
- Fix: Multiply by 10^6 when converting from scaled density to kg/m³
- Added proper housing volume calculation with assumed 500mm depth
- Fixed equipment specs property access (using width/height not plateWidth/plateHeight)
- Result: Now showing realistic masses (e.g., 100 plates = ~225kg, housing = ~55kg)

## [2025-08-08] ANALYSIS: Comprehensive Excel Structure Documentation

USER: "Analyze the Excel file structure comprehensively"
ACTION: Created detailed Excel structure analysis:

- Analyzed JSON exports of complete Excel file structure

- Identified 3-sheet data flow: технолог→снабжение→результат
- Created comprehensive documentation of all input fields, their purposes, and dependencies
- OUTPUT: EXCEL_STRUCTURE_COMPREHENSIVE.md with complete field mapping and calculation analysis

## [2025-08-08] CLIENT_DATA_COLLECTION_FORM: Test Data Collection for Validation

USER: "collect samples of excel sheet workflows from client. send them a textual form that they will fill replicating exact values that excel sheet produced. make sure you use exactly same labels as in excel sheet"
ACTION: Created comprehensive test data collection form:

- Used exact Russian field names from Excel (e.g., "типоразмер К4", "Расч Давл по Гор Ст")
- Mapped all cell references precisely (D27-V27 for технолог, F2-P13 for снабжение)
- Included all dropdown options verified against constants.ts
- Created bilingual form (Russian/English) for clarity
- Added 3 test scenario templates for different configurations
- Included category breakdown fields (J31-J36) for result validation
