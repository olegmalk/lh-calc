## Sprint 3 Risk Assessment

### HIGH RISK

- **94 remaining fields**: Large scope, potential for scope creep
- **Bitrix24 integration**: Unknown API complexity
- **Client UAT**: Potential for late-stage requirement changes

### MEDIUM RISK

- **Production deployment**: Infrastructure complexity
- **Performance**: Large dataset handling at scale
- **Timeline**: Aggressive final sprint schedule

### MITIGATION STRATEGIES

- **Phased field implementation**: Group related fields, test incrementally
- **Early Bitrix24 prototype**: Validate integration approach early
- **Client communication**: Weekly demos, early feedback loops
- **Fallback planning**: Identify MVP features if timeline pressure
