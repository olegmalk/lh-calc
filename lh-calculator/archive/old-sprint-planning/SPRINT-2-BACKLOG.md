## üîó DEPENDENCIES & RISKS

### Story Dependencies

- **S2-08 ‚Üí S2-09**: Projects must exist before assignment
- **S2-04 ‚Üí S2-05**: Load page needed before management features
- **S2-11 ‚Üí S2-12 ‚Üí S2-13**: CRM setup ‚Üí mapping ‚Üí export
- **Client credentials required for S2-11+ testing**

### Risk Mitigation

‚úÖ **Bitrix24 moved to end**: Reduces blocking risk  
‚úÖ **Core features first**: Value delivered even if CRM delayed  
‚úÖ **No backend dependencies**: All client-side implementation  
‚úÖ **Incremental delivery**: Each epic provides immediate value

### Blocking Risks

1. **Client credentials delay**: Can develop with mocks, test when available
2. **Excel format mismatch**: Test with original template early
3. **localStorage quota**: Auto-cleanup implemented
