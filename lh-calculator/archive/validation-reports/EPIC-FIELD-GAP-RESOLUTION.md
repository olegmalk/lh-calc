# EPIC: Critical Field Gap Resolution

**Epic ID**: EPIC-001  
**Status**: IN PROGRESS  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Created**: 2025-08-07  
**Epic Owner**: BMAD Scrum Master

## Epic Overview

Resolve critical field mapping and missing functionality gaps that reduce calculation accuracy from 90%+ to 20-60%. Analysis revealed significant gaps in both technologist and supply parameter coverage.

## Business Value

- **Calculation Accuracy**: Increase from 20-60% to 90-100%
- **Cost Impact**: Prevent calculation errors of trillions of rubles
- **User Coverage**: Enable full technologist and supply workflows
- **Data Integrity**: Correct field mapping prevents systematic errors

## Scope

### Phase 1: Critical Technologist Fixes

- Fix pressure/temperature field mapping bugs
- Verify existing missing fields implementation
- Document field coverage gaps

### Phase 2: Supply Tab Implementation

- Create SupplyInputForm component
- Implement role-based access control
- Add supply parameters to calculation engine
- Integrate with navigation and translations

### Success Criteria

- [ ] All technologist fields mapped correctly (100% coverage)
- [ ] All supply fields accessible via UI (100% coverage)
- [ ] Role-based access implemented (director/supply/admin)
- [ ] Calculation accuracy validated at 90%+
- [ ] All components tested and documented

## Dependencies

- Excel formula analysis (COMPLETED)
- Field mapping verification (COMPLETED)
- Role requirements clarification (PENDING CLIENT)

## Timeline

- **Phase 1**: 0.5 days (COMPLETED)
- **Phase 2**: 2 days (COMPLETED)
- **Testing & Validation**: 1 day (PENDING)

## Stories

- [LH-001] Fix pressure/temperature field mapping
- [LH-002] Verify missing technologist fields
- [LH-003] Create SupplyInputForm component
- [LH-004] Implement role-based field access
- [LH-005] Add supply parameters to types
- [LH-006] Create SupplyParameters page
- [LH-007] Add supply navigation and translations
- [LH-008] Write comprehensive test suite
- [LH-009] Validate calculation accuracy

## Risks & Mitigation

**Risk**: Client requirements unclear on role-based access  
**Mitigation**: Implemented flexible role system, pending client confirmation

**Risk**: Calculation engine integration incomplete  
**Mitigation**: Supply parameters interface ready, engine update needed

## Definition of Done (Epic Level)

- [ ] All user stories completed and tested
- [ ] QA validation passed for all acceptance criteria
- [ ] Code coverage >80% for new components
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Client acceptance received
- [ ] Production deployment completed
