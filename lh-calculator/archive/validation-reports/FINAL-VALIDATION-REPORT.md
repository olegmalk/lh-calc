## 4. Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issues Identified

1. **Density Scaling Bug**
   - Material densities appear to be using incorrect scale factors
   - Current: 0.008080 for AISI 316L
   - Should be: 8080 kg/m³ or 8.080 g/cm³
   - **Impact:** All weight calculations wrong

2. **Equipment Type Coverage Gap**
   - Only К4 series implemented in EQUIPMENT_SPECS
   - Missing К1, К2, К3 series definitions
   - **Impact:** 6 equipment types unusable

3. **Test Pressure Formula Discrepancy**
   - Current stress lookup values may not match Excel
   - Temperature interpolation possibly incorrect
   - **Impact:** Safety calculations unreliable

4. **Cost Scaling Issues**
   - Low-level weight errors cascade into cost calculations
   - Supply parameter scaling may be incorrect
   - **Impact:** All cost estimates unusable

## 5. Performance Metrics

### Acceptable Performance

- **Calculation Speed:** <100ms ✓
- **Memory Usage:** Normal ✓
- **Concurrent Handling:** Working ✓
- **Error Handling:** Robust ✓

## 6. Critical Blocking Issues

### Production Blockers

1. **Safety Calculations Incorrect** (P0)
   - Test pressures deviate significantly from Excel
   - Unsafe for production use

   - All material calculations unusable
   - Cost estimates completely wrong

3. **Missing Equipment Types** (P1)
   - 46% of equipment types not supported
   - Limited production applicability

### Must-Fix Before Production

1. Fix density scaling in material calculations
2. Correct test pressure formula implementation
3. Add missing equipment type specifications
4. Validate against known Excel test cases

## 7. Test Results Summary
