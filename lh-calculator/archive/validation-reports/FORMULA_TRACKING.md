## Formula Examples from Excel

### Simple Repetitive Pattern (appears 13x)

```excel
—Å–Ω–∞–±–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ!E110: =(E110+15)*(F110+15)*G110*7880/1000000000*2
—Å–Ω–∞–±–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ!E111: =(E111+15)*(F111+15)*G111*7880/1000000000*2
... (same pattern for all equipment types)
```

**Implementation**: One function with equipment type parameter

### Complex Lookup Pattern

```excel
—Ç–µ—Ö–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥!AI73: =INDEX(–º–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∞–ª_–ø–ª–∞—Å—Ç–∏–Ω,MATCH(1.25*J27,–¥–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ_–†—É,1),MATCH(Q27,–º–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∞–ª_–ø–ª–∞—Å—Ç–∏–Ω_–∑–∞–≥–æ–ª–æ–≤–∫–∏,0))
```

**Implementation**: Pressure-based material selection logic

### Conditional Cost Pattern

```excel
—Å–Ω–∞–±–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ!K34: =IF(—Ç–µ—Ö–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥!G27="standard",120000,IF(—Ç–µ—Ö–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥!G27="express",180000,150000))
```

**Implementation**: Delivery type cost adjustment

## Notes

1. **Most formulas are NOT unique** - they're the same calculation repeated for different equipment types
2. **Focus on patterns, not individual formulas** - implement once, apply to all equipment types
3. **The Excel has 13 equipment types** √ó ~30 calculations each = ~390 formulas that are really just 30 patterns
4. **Priority on safety calculations** - pressure tests are critical for production
