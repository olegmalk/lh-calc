- [ ] Load testing with 100 concurrent requests
- [ ] Circuit breaker pattern for Excel processing failures

### Story 4: Comprehensive Error Handling
**Priority:** High | **Story Points:** 3
**User Story:** As a developer integrating with this API, I need clear error messages so that I can debug issues quickly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Structured error responses per OpenAPI spec
- [ ] Unique request IDs for tracing
- [ ] Detailed error context (failed cells, formula errors)
- [ ] Error categorization (validation, processing, system)
- [ ] Processing time reporting
- [ ] Error logging with request correlation

**Technical Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement ErrorResponse structure from OpenAPI
- [ ] Create request ID generation (req_YYYYMMDD_XXXXX format)
- [ ] Add structured logging with correlation IDs
- [ ] Implement error categorization middleware
- [ ] Create error monitoring dashboard hooks
- [ ] Add processing time measurement

### Story 5: Bitrix24 Integration Layer
**Priority:** High | **Story Points:** 2
**User Story:** As a Bitrix24 administrator, I need the API to work seamlessly with our CRM so that sales teams can generate quotes instantly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] CORS configuration for Bitrix24 domains
